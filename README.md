# CRC-Generator-and-Checker-8-bit-
Designed and verified a parameterized 8-bit CRC module using Verilog for data integrity validation. Implemented Moore-style sequential logic with polynomial-based bitwise operations. Developed a self-checking SystemVerilog test bench with randomized input streams and automated CRC comparison.
